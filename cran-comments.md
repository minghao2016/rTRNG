## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Single-quoted software names 'TRNG' and 'RcppParallel' in both Title and Description fields.

Note that no reference about the methods behind 'TRNG' is available in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>, to be included in the Description field. The main reference is the PDF manual of 'TRNG', which is listed among the References in the relevant man pages of the package.



This is a new release.
